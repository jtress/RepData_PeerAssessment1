data1 <- data[complete.cases(data),]
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
answer1 <- tapply(data1$steps, data1$date, FUN = sum)
hist(answer1)
mean(answer1)
median(answer1)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
answer2 <- tapply(data1$steps, data1$interval, FUN = mean)
plot(row.names(answer2), answer2)
```
