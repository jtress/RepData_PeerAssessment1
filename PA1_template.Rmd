## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "Date", "numeric"))
data1 <- data[complete.cases(data),]
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
answer1 <- tapply(data1$steps, data1$date, FUN = sum)
hist(answer1)
m1 <- mean(answer1)
m2<- median(answer1)
```

The mean total number of steps taken per day is `r m1`.
The median total number of steps taken per day is `r m2`.


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
answer2 <- tapply(data1$steps, data1$interval, FUN = mean)
plot(row.names(answer2), answer2)
maxint <- row.names(answer2)[which.max(answer2)]
```

The 5 minute interval, on average, with the maximum number of steps is `r maxint`.

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
